## Description

For this project, I refactored the Horiseon webpage to make it accessible by ensuring all links were functioning correctly, cleaned up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidated CSS selectors and properties, organized them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and included comments before each element or section of the page.
